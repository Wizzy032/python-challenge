# python-challenge
- PyBank Challenge- This project involves creating a Python script that analyzes the financial records of a company using data from a CSV file. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# Files
- `main.py`: The Python script that performs the analysis.
- `Resources/`: Contains the dataset (`budget_data 2.csv`) used for the analysis.
- `analysis/`: Stores the output text file of the analysis results.

- PyPoll Challenge- This Challenge involves helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The dataset used is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

I employed the same process as the PyBank challenge and have the same file structure. 

I cloned my repository on my desktop, ran the script using terminal and git commit.
